    <h1>Skeleton Key</h1>

    <p>
      Skeleton Key is a password generator that uses
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> to generate
      secure, unique passwords for each website and account. It uses a master
      password of your choosing, a unique &ldquo;site key&rdquo;, and your
      username on the site to generate the password. This process is algorithmic,
      meaning the same combination of inputs will always generate the same
      output password. Skeleton Key hashes your password with the site key and
      username 1,000 times, making it virtually impossible to get back your
      original password.

      This web page has been built for offline use, meaning that your web
      browser can display Skeleton Key even without a network connection. This
      allows you to lookup your passwords at any time. There is also a
      <a href="#">Chrome Extension</a> that you can install. The
      <a href="https://github.com/rsesek/skeletonkey">source code is also
      available</a>.
